This project is forked from 

# chrono-football
It is a proof-of-concept game that reminds me a childhood game that we play with chronometers on our watch.
You start and stop the chronometer and take the last digit as move. If last digit is greater than 2, it counts as score (it is parametrized of course).

### Quick Start
Starting the project with hot-reloading enabled
(the first time it will take a while):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If you wish you can run backend & frontend in seperate.
